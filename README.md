Windows Privesc Check - Powershell version
==========================================

After trying to fix the code of the original Windows Privesc Check tool and crying rivers of blood I decided to look for a more appropriate tool for the task. This is a try implementing similar functionality in Powershell, that is available by default in every Windows installation since Windows 7/Server 2008 R2. 

This is my first Powershell project, but I still hope that my code will be better than the monolithic Python-Pyinstaller-ASCIIonly predecessor.
